                            <p>It's no secret that car shopping is a challenge right now. Inflation is raising the prices of everything, including cars. Supply chain issues continue to ripple through the automobile market, and inventories for new and used cars are still below their normal levels. But that doesn't mean you have to sacrifice quality or buy the first used car you find with a price tag that fits your budget.
                                We've rounded up 11 of the best used cars with minimum average prices below $20,000. These are cars with few or no compromises – cars that you'll be happy to drive. They all have high U.S. News overall scores, and several were finalists or winners for our annual Best Cars for the Money awards when they were new. We looked for things like roomy interiors, good cargo capacity and robust standard features lists. In some cases, we recommend looking for a higher trim that still fits under our $20,000 price cap.
                                
                                Used car prices vary according to trim levels, condition and even region, so you'll want to compare local pricing of comparable models. And be sure to read the full reviews to learn more about each car.</p>

                            <p>Amazon Echo speakers are among the most affordable and easy-to-set-up smart speakers out there. That's why the fourth-generation Amazon Echo is our pick for top smart speaker overall. It's likely to best meet the needs of most households. Though it's a few years old, the device features improved sound quality over the previous generation, is compatible with an assortment of smart devices, and goes for the relatively affordable price of $100 (though it can often be found on sale for $80 or less).</p>

                        <p>Although Kadima is beloved, it’s not for everyone. If you didn’t grow up perfecting your tennis serve, it can be hard to get a rally going — and even if you do have a killer backhand, the people you’re picnicking with might not. The solution, as our contributing writer Ivy Pochoda explains, is Street Racket. It’s a paddle sport played with an oversize yellow ball that is allowed to bounce, reducing the need for constant volleying. The rectangular playing field (which can be drawn with the game’s included chalk sticks or simply marked out in sand or snow) is divided into three squares. “Players stand in the two outer squares and compete over the middle square, which essentially functions as a net,” says Pochoda. “You score a point when your opponent either misses your square or is unable to return your shot from within their square, kind of like tennis.” The game, which can expand endlessly as you add more players and racquets and can also be played solo against a wall, is surprisingly fast-paced and fun; Pochoda is a squash pro and found it suitably challenging. If you tire of the usual rules, it even includes an app with more than 100 variations and exercises to complete.</p>
